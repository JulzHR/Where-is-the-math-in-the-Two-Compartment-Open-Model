# Where is the math in the Two Compartment Open Model? by Julio Reyes

Welcome! This repository presents my mathematical modeling project exploring how pharmacokinetic models, specifically the **two compartment open model**, describe drug movement through the body.

**Note:** I will focus **exclusively on the theoretical background and mathematical derivation** of the equations that govern the model. It does not include experimental or clinical data, but instead highlights the math behind how we understand drug distribution in the body. :)

Hi! I'm Julio Hern√°ndez Reyes, a Chemistry major student with a minor in Mathematics. I'm passionate  

## Introduction

After taking the course Introduction to Pharmacology, I got interested in how pharmacokinetics work. Nonetheless, due to time constraints and because it is an introductory course, the graphs of the model were only shown without a true understanding of the math behind them. Now that I have the opportunity, I would like to see the how math describe the biological or chemical processes that are happening in drug distribution, how the equation of the model is obtained and how are the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained.

## Hands On

As stated in the [Video Presenting Classmates](), the basic idea of the model is to keep track of the amount of drug that goes inside and ouside the compartment as shown in the following equation:

$$
\frac{dC_n}{dt}=Input\space rate\space of\space drug-Output\space rate\space of\space drug
$$
